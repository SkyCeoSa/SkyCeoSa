# Hi, I'm Sadegh 👋

Founder & Quant Researcher at **NeuronAlgo**  
Algorithmic Trading • Quant Research • AI Systems

I design **robust, reproducible trading systems** spanning classical quantitative finance, machine learning, and production-grade execution. My work focuses on turning research into **deployable, risk-aware trading modules** suitable for prop firms, funded accounts, and startup incubation.

🌍 Focus regions: **UAE (Dubai)** & **Oman**

## What I Do

### Quant Research
- Statistical arbitrage & cross-asset strategies
- Feature engineering for financial time series
- Volatility modeling & regime detection
- Point-in-time data pipelines (bias-aware)

### Machine Learning & AI
- Qlib-based ML research workflows
- Supervised learning for return & risk prediction
- Experimental reinforcement learning agents
- Early-stage LLM-assisted research automation

### Production & Execution
- Strategy deployment via **MT5 (MQL5 EAs)**
- Execution-aware backtesting frameworks
- Risk controls, drawdown limits, capital allocation logic
- Research → pilot → live migration pipelines

---

## Track Record & Proof (Selective)

- ✅ Multiple funded prop-firm challenge passes
- ✅ Live Expert Advisors (MQL5) running **1+ year**  
- 🧾 Verified statements & certificates available **under NDA**  
- ⚠️ Public repositories contain **sanitized demos**, not full production logic

## Open Research & Portfolio

📌 **Primary Portfolio Repository**  
👉 https://github.com/SkyCeoSa/neuronalgo-quant-portfolio

Includes:
- Qlib ML training & backtesting pipelines  
- Smart Money Concept backtester (rule-based)  
- Experimental RL research platform  
- Modular research scaffolds & strategy cards  

Each project is documented for **technical review, not marketing**.

## Philosophy

- Reproducibility > curve fitting  
- Risk-adjusted returns > raw PnL  
- Process > prediction  
- Capital protection is a feature, not a constraint  

I strongly separate:
- **Research artifacts**
- **Pilot-grade systems**
- **Live production strategies**

---

## Collaboration & Opportunities

I am open to:
- Funded trading accounts (profit split models)
- Quant research partnerships
- Startup incubation & venture studios
- Proprietary trading desks & family offices

Engagements typically start with:
- Short pilot (capital-limited)
- Transparent reporting
- Clear risk boundaries
